<DefaultLayout title="About">
  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    I’m Benjamin Tan, a software engineer hailing from Singapore.
    I’m passionate about using software to create meaningful products and experiences.
    I work primarily with modern web technologies these days, although I dabble with systems software occasionally.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m currently building <a href="https://mobbin.com/">Mobbin</a>, an app design reference library.
  </p>
  <p>
    I occasionally spend time working on open source code.
    In the past, I’ve been a member of the <a href="https://lodash.com/">lodash</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bestiejs">BestieJS</a>, <a href="https://webtorrent.io/">WebTorrent</a>, and <a href="https://advisory.sg/">Advisory</a> teams.
    Recently, I’ve been excited about programming languages, databases, distributed systems, version control systems, and cryptography.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of staring at computers, you can typically find me either face-deep in a book, watching football, listening to <a href="https://music.ofcr.se/">music</a>, or just sleeping.

  <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
  <p>
    Want to get in touch? I’m probably the most contactable <a href="https://twitter.com/bnjmnt4n">on Twitter</a> (I refuse to call it X) or <a href="mailto:benjamin@ofcr.se">through email</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Colophon</h2>
  <p>
    ofcrse is a static site built using <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>.
    It runs on a custom <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum">Axum-based</a> server deployed on <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly.io</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Design is inspired from <a href="https://brandur.org/">Brandur Leach’s site</a>.
    Text is typeset in <a href="https://www.atipofoundry.com/fonts/basier-narrow">Basier Narrow Square</a>, <a href="https://typeof.net/Iosevka/">Iosevka</a>, and one of your system’s serif fonts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why is it called <code>ofcrse</code>? Who knows? I bought the domain way too long ago, and now I’m stuck with it.
